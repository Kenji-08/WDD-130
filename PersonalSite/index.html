      <h3>Phrases and Culture</h3>
      <p>Useful Phrases</p>
      <p>Sumimasen すみません will be your best friend in Japan. The usual translation is “excuse me” with a polite connotation. 
      If you say sumimasen and point to something or even say a word that is usually enough and is even preferable to ask questions. 
      For example, you need to find a restroom, “えっとすみません、トイレは？” “etto sumimasen, toire wa”? meaning “Um excuse me, the 
      toilet/restroom is (where is implied here)”</p>
      <p>TODO: add more</p>


      <p>Table Manners and Restaurant Culture</p>
      <p>It is common to say itadakimasu いただきます, which basically means let’s eat, after everyone has gotten their food and before eating.
      TODO: add more</p>
      <p>It’s considered rude to make loud sounds in restaurants. Things like burping, slurping, and audible munching to name a few.
      If you’re American you’ll be relieved to hear that tipping in Japan is very rare. If you do tip, they will most likely turn 
      it down out of humbleness which is big in Japanese culture. 
      Don’t eat outside and expect trash cans to be few and far between outside. It’s an expectation to hold onto trash 
      until you find a place to dispose of it.</p>

        <!-- TODO: Week 08 - change this -->
        <b>Pronunciation Guide</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        May put superscript links on JP words from other places and link them here on how to say them, and a 
        general guide on saying vowels for those who really want it to be close.
      </p>
      <p>More in-depth Pronunciation</p>
      <p>Vowels</p>

        
      <p>Visual example of the different positions in the mouth from ToFuGu</p>
      
      <p>Visual example of where the tongue should be for each vowel from ToFuGu</p>
      <p>あ(a) pronounced like a short “ah” where the tongue should be in the back while being low in the mouth</p>
      <p>え(e) pronounced like the “e” in “men”, the tongue is in the front while being low</p>
      <p>い(i) pronounced like the “e” in “me”, the tongue is in front while being higher in the mouth</p>
      <p>お(o) pronounced like the “o” in “open”, the tongue is in the back while being in the middle height-wise</p>
      <p>う(u) pronounced like the “oo” in “Winnie the Pooh”, the tongue is in the back and is shaped like a slide where the back of the tongue is in the top, middle of the tongue is in the middle, and the front of the tongue is on the bottom to middle.</p>

      <p>Glottal Stops</p>
      <p>Glottal stops are achieved by stopping the airflow in the beginning of a consonant and then using airflow to pronounce it 
      e.g. “clipboard” and “background”. You don’t say “clipuh-board” nor do you say “backuh-ground”. Glottal stops are denoted by 
      a っwhich looks like a small つ or in romaji (English letters essentially) it will have the consonant doubled e.g. kippu  きっぷ.</p>
